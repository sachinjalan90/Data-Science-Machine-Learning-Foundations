# **1. Introduction**
---

- Who doesn't like watching movies? They're a great source of entertainment and also highly addictive if you get your hands on to some good stuff. A good movie is a perfect compound of story, plot, direction, acting and cinematography. Once you have these in near perfect amounts, viewers are hooked.


- With the popularity of OTT platforms exploding (thanks to Covid), there are more movies than ever before and rightly so. There are hundreds of movies in almost every genre and even new genres have started coming up. Netflix recently introduced us to a new tech in their popular Black Mirror series where the viewer could choose the actions of the character. Another point aiding to the ever growing popularity of movies is the fact that stress levels are increasing throughout the world and people need an outlet to let go off some steam. Movies are a great way to do that!


- Due to such a massive demand for movies, there's no doubt that money follows it like a loyal puppy. And who doesn't want to ride this bandwagon, eh! Thus, producers and distributors are constantly looking out for some great content that will help them earn millions in revenues (if not billions). Of course, good art always deserves appreciation and while there are many ways to express this gesture, financial payment is the most soughted after.

- In last few years, the film industry has become more popular than ever.

- In 2018, movies made total income around $ 41.7 billion throughout the world.

- But what movies make the most money at the box office?

- How much does a director matter?

- Do ratings and metascore mean anything? Do certain actors and/or genre amount to good revenues for producers?
