## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Fuel consumption testing & determination of CO2 emissions
It would be difficult to drive every model of new vehicle on the road to measure fuel consumption and CO2 emission. And it would be impossible to get repeatable results that way because so many factors – road conditions and weather, to name just two – can affect a vehicle’s performance.

That is why vehicle manufacturers use standard, controlled laboratory testing and analytical procedures to generate the fuel consumption data that appear on the EnerGuide label for vehicles.

Environment and Climate Change Canada collects the data from vehicle manufacturers. Natural Resources Canada puts the data and other information together and publish the Fuel Consumption & CO2 emissions. We will be using the dataset published by Natural Resources Canada.

## 2. Problem Statement
Nowadays, one of the biggest challenges is to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) from the transport industry. In particular, the road transport sector accounts for about 80% of the whole energy demand required by transportation and, due to its reliance on fossil fuels, represents one of the most important sources of Green House Gases emissions in the world.

Here we have the dataset of new light duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada, where we have different Car models and their corresponding CO2 emissions when drove over Highway as well as on City roads.

Using this Dataset let us try to find out the following:

a. What are the variables that directly influence the CO2 emissions?
b. Develop an equation which gives the relationship between the CO2 emissions and the       variables that influence it?
